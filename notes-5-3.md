## notes

- basic removal and interpolation of TEP
- ICA will do better, but need to understand how it works and how to apply it
- feat extr: try out which way is most practical (mne or numpy)
- is clustering on spTEP or rsEEG?

## Todo

- ~~check preprocessing interpolation, check graph~~
- improve preprocessing; check other papers for which steps are applied and how this could be achieved in scipy, numpy, etc
- ICA; implementation and theory
- feature extraction from spectrogram and wavelet transforms
- testing of clustering (pre vs post rsEEG & spTEP); kmeans & dbscan -->

## TODO

- **deftige vragen maken over preprocessing**
- extract meaningful features
  - spectrogram (frequency domain)
  - wavelet (time-frequency domain)
- apply clustering
